We use [Func Unit](https://funcunit.com/) to test and simulate the interactions in our day to day to code.
Today I got chance to look into the usage of [FuncUnit.missing](https://funcunit.com/docs/FuncUnit.prototype.missing.html) in a code review. 

This API seems to be have an intersting name and intersting functionality. This waits till the element disappers from the view. This  could be useful to see whether a domNode disapper on the operation.
