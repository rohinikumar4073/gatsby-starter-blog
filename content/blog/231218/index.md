Today I was going through the solid principles training. I made some good understanding of UML notation and single responsibility principles.

## Inheritance 

This is "IS A " relationship. For example Swift is a Bird. This is indicated by lollypop. 

## Assosiation
This is a bidirectional relationship

## Aggregation
This is HAS A relation 

## COMPOSITION


Single Responsibity of a class means the class has a single reason to change. 

Observer pattern is a single responsibility principle.
