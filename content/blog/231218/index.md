Today I was going through the solid principles training. I had understood key conceptsof UML notation and single responsibility principle.

## Inheritance 

This is "IS A " relationship. For example Swift is a Bird. This is indicated by lollypop. 

## Assosiation
This is a bidirectional relationship

## Aggregation
This is HAS A relation . If you take A and B classes. A class can exist without other class, but B will be having A.
## COMPOSITION
This is a tight coupled HAS A relationship.
## SRP
Single Responsibity of a class means the class has a single reason to change. 
Observer pattern with MVC follows single responsibility principle.
