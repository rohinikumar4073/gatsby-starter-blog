The rotate API works very differently. It takes where the previous one is left and rotate from there.
For example you have to create lines across circle with a distance.

1 . Use rotate(PI/3) and draw a line
2 .Use rotate(PI/3) and draw a line again
3 . Use rotate(PI/3) and draw a line
THis creates a circle with three lines
