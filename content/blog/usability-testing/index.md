We had a usability testing by an UX expert in our team on a feature that I am working upon. It was very humbling experience to listen it. 
### Learnings
1. The way I  percieve our work is not the same way that users percieve it. 
2. Being smart comes becomes very inconvienent if it causes trouble. 
3. Users are trying the alternatives if main things are not working fine.
4. There would be not be only mouse way of achieving this 
5. User could be able to do with Keyboard and Screen reader too.
