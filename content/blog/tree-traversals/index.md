Introduction to Data Structures
 ### Arrays ###
1. Array is a random access data structure
2. Linked List is a sequential data structure
    a. Advantages of linked list are we can add data dynamically at any point of time, Size of the array need not mention at the start of the time.
### STACKS ###
1. First In Last Out
### QUEUE ###
1. First in First Out
### TREES ###
1. Binary tree is a tree which has left node and right node
Graph Theroy is study of relationships between edges and vertexes.
In graph theory tree is an undirected, connected and cyclic graph.
## Depth first traversal 
#### InOrder Traversal ####
 1. In this preorder traversal  we will go left, root and then right node.
 
 #### PreOrder Traversal ####
 1. In this preorder traversal  we will go root,left and then right node.

 ### PostOrder Traversal ###
  1. In this preorder traversal  we will go left,right and then root node.

 ## Bipartite graph
 ## Cyclic graph
 ## Acyclic graph

 ## Searching and Sorting
###  Linear Search 
    Linear search is a way to find an element with in a list by sequential going through each one

Time complexity N

### Binary Search
    Binary search works on the sorted array. The comparsion of the element to be found is done at the half of the array .
    If the match is not found then the element goes to the first half or the second half based on the comparision.
    Time complexity **logN**

# Sorting

## Selection Sort
 In this case the minimum value is found and swaps with the first element and so on till all the elements are sorted.

 ## Insertion Sort
 This is like playing a cards. Imaging you have one card at your hand. You are picking a card and placing it exactly at the position. 

 ## Merge Sort
 Divide and Conquer , More work in combine less work in divide

 ## Quick Sort
More work in divide and less work in conquer

 ## Bubbles 

 # DBMS
 # Data Modelling
    Functional Dependency in RDBMS
    
    A -> Atomcity
    C -> Consistency
    I -> Isolation
    D -> Durability

    Logical
    Physcial
    External

    DML (Data Manipulation language)
        SELECT
        INSERT
        UPDATE
        DELETE
    DCL
        GRANT
        REVOKE
    TCL
        COMMIT
        ROLLBACK

    Candidate Key 
    Super Keys
        An unique combination of keys that is useful identify the row
