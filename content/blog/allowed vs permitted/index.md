# What is the difference between Allow and Permit ?

Allow and Permit has the same meaning. Permit is more formal than Allow.

# JS COVERAGE
Today I was going through the report of JS Code Coverage . We use [JS Cover](https://tntim96.github.io/JSCover/). There was three sections of percentages for all the JS files. 
These three sections give percentage of the code covered with the tests.

## Code Coverage
 - I belive this is the percentage of code that got executed in the tests
## Branch Coverage
 - This is percentages of branches covered to total number of branches
## Function Coverage 
 - This is percentages of functions covered to total number of functions
